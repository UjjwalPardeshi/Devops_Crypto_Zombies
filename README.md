## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18.x or higher)
* npm / yarn
* An Ethereum development environment (e.g., Hardhat, Truffle)
* (Add any other requirements)

### Installation & Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/UjjwalPardeshi/Devops_Crypto_Zombies.git](https://github.com/UjjwalPardeshi/Devops_Crypto_Zombies.git)
    cd Devops_Crypto_Zombies
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd project
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the project:**
    *(Add the command to run your project, e.g., compile contracts, run tests, or start a server)*
    ```bash
    # Example:
    npx hardhat compile
    npx hardhat test
    npm run dev
    ```

## ü§ñ CI/CD Workflow

This repository uses GitHub Actions for automation. The workflow file(s) can be found in `.github/workflows/`.

The current pipeline automates the following tasks:
* (e.g., Running tests on every push)
* (e.g., Linting the code)
* (e.g., Building the project)
* (e.g., Deploying to a testnet or production)
